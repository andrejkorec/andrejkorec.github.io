        <p>I live and create in the village Nemčice near the town Topoľčany. My study at the Industrial College of Woodworking led naturally to work with the wood and process the interest about art and painting what was natural for me from my childhood.</p>
        <p>The contact with painting as a hobby has stimulated preparation - stretched canvas and advancement of skills in preparing the surface for painting. Here, the idea was born to offer my experience further and created materials for professional artists, students, and people in order to build up.</p>
        <p>I offer you more than just a stretched canvas; I offer you my experience. Not least my personal approach to each of you. All is based on cooperation with professional artists in Slovakia and also in the Czech Republic which was established in fruitful collaborations, for which I am grateful.</p>
