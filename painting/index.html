      <p class="mb-1">My paintings are based on notes, sketches and doodles made during the day, by traveling or listening the music. They are notations that recorded my personal feelings of situations and experiences.</p>
      <p class="mb-0">I repaint them and enlarge them on the canvas. I’m fascinated by emptiness which appear and by silence of detail in huge scale. I’m working with detail of bigger image, where “action” is happening somewhere outside the picture.</p>
